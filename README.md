## Overview

Can a machine learning model predict which country a photo was taken in better than humans can? This project fine-tunes an EfficientNet-B0 convolutional neural network on ~500,000 street-view images from the [OpenStreetView-5M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/osv5m/osv5m) dataset, then statistically compares its accuracy against a five-person case study group using McNemar's test.

**Key result:** The model achieves **64.7% accuracy** on 1,000 test images across 161 countries, significantly outperforming all human participants (8.7%–15.3% individually, 18.8% as a group oracle). All McNemar tests reject the null hypothesis at alpha = 0.05.

## Quick Start

### Option A: Google Colab (recommended)

1. Click the **Open in Colab** badge above (or [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tysonjohnsondev/geolocation-project/blob/main/geolocation_guesser.ipynb))
2. **Runtime > Run all** — the notebook automatically clones this repo and loads all data
3. No setup, no uploads, no GPU needed (default mode runs analysis only)

### Option B: Local (VS Code, JupyterLab, etc.)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tysonjohnsondev/geolocation-project.git
cd geolocation-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook geolocation_guesser.ipynb
```

Then **Run All Cells**. The notebook detects it's already inside the repo and skips cloning.

Pinned dependency versions are in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt). Training and `evaluate` modes add a few GPU-only deps (`torch`, `torchvision`, `timm`, `datasets`) that are commented out of the base install — uncomment them if you have a GPU and want to re-run the model, not just the analysis.

## Run Modes

The notebook supports three modes via the `MODE` variable in the first code cell:

| Mode | What it does | Time | GPU? |
|------|-------------|------|------|
| `"analysis_only"` (default) | Loads pre-computed results, runs all statistical analysis and figures | ~1 min | No |
| `"evaluate"` | Downloads OSV-5M test shards, loads our checkpoint, re-runs model evaluation, then analysis | ~30 min | Yes |
| `"train"` | Full training from scratch (~500K images, 6 epochs) + evaluation + analysis | ~2 hrs | Yes (A100) |

In `"evaluate"` and `"train"` modes, OSV-5M shards are downloaded from HuggingFace and cached to your Google Drive (if mounted) so subsequent runs skip the download. You'll need to set a HuggingFace token (`export HF_TOKEN=hf_your_token`) to access the dataset. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values — the same file also documents `GEOGUESS_EXPORT_KEY`, the opaque secret that gates the webapp's `/api/export` endpoint.

## Methodology

### Part A — Model Training

EfficientNet-B0 (5.3M parameters), pretrained on ImageNet, fine-tuned on ~500,000 OSV-5M street-view images across 180 countries. Trained for 6 epochs with AdamW (lr=3e-4), cosine LR schedule, mixed precision, and early stopping. Achieves 75.0% validation top-1 accuracy and 57.6% test accuracy on the full held-out evaluation set.

### Part B — Human Data Collection

A custom Flask webapp deployed at `https://tysonjohnson.dev/countryguesser/` presented 1,000 test images to five case study participants, who produced 2,579 total guesses across all 1,000 images. The webapp prioritizes showing overlapping images to maximize paired comparisons.

### Part C — Statistical Analysis

McNemar's test compares paired binary outcomes (correct/incorrect) on the same images between the model and each human participant. Three group aggregation methods (any-correct oracle, majority vote, average score) provide group-level comparisons. All tests reject H_0 with overwhelming significance.

## Results

| Entity | Accuracy | N |
|--------|----------|---|
| EfficientNet-B0 (current checkpoint) | **64.70%** | 1,000 |
| Older checkpoint (served live during data collection) | 32.10% | 1,000 |
| Group (any correct) | 18.80% | 1,000 |
| Group (majority vote) | 6.80% | 1,000 |
| Heeseung (best individual) | 15.28% | 144 |
| Random baseline | 0.62% | — |

## Try the Webapp Locally

The `webapp/` directory contains the Flask app used to collect human guesses during the experiment. You can run it locally to see the guessing interface firsthand, or try the live version at [tysonjohnson.dev/countryguesser](https://tysonjohnson.dev/countryguesser/).

![Guessing interface](docs/webapp_screenshot.png)

![Result feedback](docs/webapp_result.png)

```bash
pip install flask
cd webapp
python app.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000`. The app automatically extracts test images from `data/original1000.zip` and generates its manifest from `data/experiment_data.json` on first run — no manual setup needed.

There's also a `webapp_points/` variant that uses GeoGuessr-style distance scoring (click on a map to place a pin, scored by haversine distance) instead of binary country matching.

## Deployed vs. Committed Model

The live site at `tysonjohnson.dev/countryguesser` currently serves predictions generated by the **older** checkpoint (`data/best_model.pt`, 32.1% on the 1,000-image benchmark), while the statistical analysis in this notebook uses the **newer** checkpoint (`data/best_model_efficientnet_b0.pt`, 64.7%). This divergence is intentional: all 2,579 human guesses were collected while the older model was live, so the paired McNemar's comparisons have to be scored against the checkpoint humans were actually matched against. Both checkpoints stay committed for auditability.

For the full rationale plus the commands to sync the live site to the newer checkpoint after data collection closes, see [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md). The committed model is documented in detail — training data, hyperparameters, metrics, limitations — in [`MODEL_CARD.md`](MODEL_CARD.md).
